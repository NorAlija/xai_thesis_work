## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for my thesis project. The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and making new predictions. The key steps are organized into several sections, each addressing a specific part of the process.

## Importing Dataset

This section focuses on importing the dataset required for the analysis. The dataset is loaded into the environment to be processed and used for model training.

## Data Preprocessing

In this section, the raw data is cleaned and preprocessed. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or scaling features as necessary.

## Feature Selection / Train-Test Split

Feature selection is performed to identify the most relevant variables for the model. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Training the Model

This section covers the training of the machine learning model using the preprocessed data. Different algorithms and hyperparameters may be explored to optimize model performance.

## Saving the Model

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it is saved to disk for future use. This allows for the model to be loaded and used without retraining.

## New Prediction

In this section, new data is used to make predictions using the trained model. This demonstrates the practical application of the model to real-world data.

## LIME

LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is used to explain the predictions of the machine learning model. This section demonstrates how LIME can be applied to understand and interpret the model's predictions, making the model more transparent and trustworthy
